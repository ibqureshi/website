        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            From a young age, I’ve been surrounded by diverse hobbies and experiences, being the youngest of four siblings. Snowboarding, photography, and traveling have all played a role in shaping my perspective, but it was medicine that captivated me. Medicine uniquely combines hands-on skills, intellectual rigor, and constant learning—all while interacting with and helping people. This dynamic nature drew me in and continues to fuel my passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I’m pursuing my Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) at New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYITCOM) as part of an integrated 7-year B.S./D.O. program. The flexibility of this program has allowed me to explore my varied interests in research, coding, and videography, alongside my medical studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I have been involved in several research projects across orthopedic surgery, sports medicine, and geriatrics. My recent research focuses on analyzing injury trends in professional sports leagues, including the National Hockey League (NHL) and European football leagues, as well as studying the effects of Ramadan on injury rates in Muslim athletes. I am committed to applying data-driven methodologies to improve patient outcomes, especially in the field of sports medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academics and research, I’m passionate about mentoring and giving back to the community. I’ve coached teams for national competitions, led marketing initiatives, and worked in clinical settings to bridge the gap between healthcare access and patient care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking forward, I’m actively seeking opportunities to further my clinical experience, expand my research portfolio, and leverage my coding skills in the healthcare space. Whether in a clinical setting, research lab, or community project, I am dedicated to improving patient outcomes through ethical and innovative solutions.
