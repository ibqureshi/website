                <h1>Ibraheem Qureshi</h1>
                <p>Welcome! I'm a third-year medical student based in New York. I'm passionate about medicine and seeing beauty in the world. When I'm not busy working on research projects focused on orthopedic surgery, I like to read a gripping fantasy novel, learn more about my heritage, take pictures of the mundane, and catch a game of my favorite team, Manchester United.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up as the youngest of four siblings, I was surrounded by a whirlwind of hobbies and passions that shaped my worldview. From snowboarding down winter slopes to capturing everyday moments through the lens of my camera, Iâ€™ve always found beauty in the world around me. Amidst all these experiences, medicine captivated me through its intersection of human connection and scientific reasoning. It offers a blend of intellectual challenge, hands-on practice, and personal interactionâ€”constantly pushing me to learn, adapt, and serve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being surrounded by family projects, our garage became a treasure trove of saws, screws, and materials. As a family, we tackled everything from building closets to repairing cars, and these projects became a natural part of my upbringing. I absorbed the determination it takes to turn raw materials into something functional and new. Naturally, this upbringing drew me toward orthopedics, a specialty focused on making the broken functional again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether Iâ€™m analyzing data for orthopedic research or filming creative projects in my downtime, Iâ€™m driven by a desire to merge these passions into a career where I can make meaningful contributions to healthcare. Whether in the lab, clinic, or behind the camera, Iâ€™m excited to carve a path that integrates both science and art into a fulfilling medical career.

            <h2>Research Projects</h2>
            
            <h3>Orthopedic Surgery and Sports Medicine</h3>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on projects that focus on sports injuries and orthopedic surgery across various institutions. My work has examined injury rates in professional sports leagues, with a particular interest in how specific variables like bye weeks, the use of turf fields, and unique events like the Winter Olympics affect injury outcomes.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Injury Rates in the National Hockey League (NHL)</strong>: Analysis of injury patterns before and after the introduction of a midseason bye week.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact of the Winter Olympics on NHL Injuries</strong>: Investigating increased injury risks in years when NHL players participate in the Winter Olympics.</li>
                <li><strong>Turf vs. Grass in Major League Soccer (MLS)</strong>: Assessing the injury rates on different playing surfaces in the MLS.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unique Orthopedic Case Reports</h3>
            <p>
                Working under Dr. Mustafa Javed Bhalli, I have compiled case reports on unique orthopedic cases encountered in his international practice. These cases provide valuable insights into unusual presentations and treatment approaches.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orthopedic Injuries During Ramadan</strong>: A project assessing injury risks among Muslim footballers during Ramadan, demonstrating that fasting does not necessarily increase injury risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Female Authorship and Trends in Orthopedic Journals</h3>
            <p>
                As part of an ongoing initiative, Iâ€™ve been involved in evaluating female authorship trends in leading orthopedic journals. This project sheds light on the representation of female researchers in the field and its evolution over time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authorship Trends in Orthopedic Journals (2018-2023)</strong>: Analyzing female first and senior author rates in top orthopedic publications across different regions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Geriatric Orthopedics and Multidisciplinary Care</h3>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ve contributed to reviews focusing on geriatric patients, particularly on how multidisciplinary care can improve outcomes in older adults with rib fractures.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rib Fracture Management in Older Adults</strong>: A scoping review that explores best practices for managing rib fractures in the geriatric population.</li>
            </ul>
