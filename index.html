                <h1>Ibraheem Qureshi</h1>
                <p>Welcome! I'm a third-year medical student based in New York. I'm passionate about medicine and seeing beauty in the world. When I'm not busy working on research projects focused on orthopedic surgery, I like to read a gripping fantasy novel, learn more about my heritage, take pictures of the mundane, and catch a game of my favorite team, Manchester United.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up as the youngest of four siblings, I was surrounded by a whirlwind of hobbies and passions that shaped my worldview. From snowboarding down winter slopes to capturing everyday moments through the lens of my camera, Iâ€™ve always found beauty in the world around me. Amidst all these experiences, medicine captivated me through its intersection of human connection and scientific reasoning. It offers a blend of intellectual challenge, hands-on practice, and personal interactionâ€”constantly pushing me to learn, adapt, and serve.

            <p>
                Being surrounded by family projects, our garage became a treasure trove of saws, screws, and materials. As a family, we tackled everything from building closets to repairing cars, and these projects became a natural part of my upbringing. I absorbed the determination it takes to turn raw materials into something functional and new. Naturally, this upbringing drew me toward orthopedics, a specialty focused on making the broken functional again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether Iâ€™m analyzing data for orthopedic research or filming creative projects in my downtime, Iâ€™m driven by a desire to merge these passions into a career where I can make meaningful contributions to healthcare. Whether in the lab, clinic, or behind the camera, Iâ€™m excited to carve a path that integrates both science and art into a fulfilling medical career.
