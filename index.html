<h1 style = "font-size: 20px;">IBRAHEEM QURESHI</h1>
<p style = "font-size: 14px;">Hello! I'm a third-year medical student based in New York. I'm passionate about medicine and seeing beauty in the world. When I'm not busy working on research projects focused on orthopedic surgery, I like to read a gripping fantasy novel, learn more about my heritage, take pictures of the mundane, and catch a game of my favorite team, Manchester United.</p>
<p></p>
<p> I am pursuing my Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree in an expedited 7-year program, combining my love for research, coding, and the ever-evolving medical field.  </p>

    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <p> Growing up as the youngest of four siblings, I was surrounded by a whirlwind of hobbies and passions that shaped my worldview. From snowboarding down winter slopes to capturing everyday moments through the lens of my camera, I’ve always found beauty in the world around me. Amidst all these experiences, medicine captivated me through its intersection of human connection and scientific reasoning. It offers a blend of intellectual challenge, hands-on practice, and personal interaction—constantly pushing me to learn, adapt, and serve. </p>
    <p> Whether I’m analyzing data for orthopedic research or filming creative projects in my downtime, I’m driven by a desire to merge these passions into a career where I can make meaningful contributions to healthcare. Whether in the lab, clinic, or behind the camera, I’m excited to carve a path that integrates both science and art into a fulfilling medical career. </p>

      <h2> Orthopedic Surgery and Sports Medicine </h2>
      <p> I’ve had the privilege of working on projects that focus on sports injuries and orthopedic surgery across various institutions. My work has examined injury rates in professional sports leagues, with a particular interest in how specific variables like bye weeks, the use of turf fields, and unique events like the Winter Olympics affect injury outcomes. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Injury Rates in the National Hockey League (NHL): Analysis of injury patterns before and after the introduction of a midseason bye week.</li>
        <li>Impact of the Winter Olympics on NHL Injuries: Investigating increased injury risks in years when NHL players participate in the Winter Olympics.</li>
        <li>Turf vs. Grass in Major League Soccer (MLS): Assessing the injury rates on different playing surfaces in the MLS.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Unique Orthopedic Case Reports </h2>
      <p> Working under Dr. Mustafa Javed Bhalli, I have compiled case reports on unique orthopedic cases encountered in his international practice. These cases provide valuable insights into unusual presentations and treatment approaches. </p>

      <h2> Female Authorship and Trends in Orthopedic Journals </h2>
      <p> As part of an ongoing initiative, I’ve been involved in evaluating female authorship trends in leading orthopedic journals. This project sheds light on the representation of female researchers in the field and its evolution over time. </p>
      <ul>

      <h2> Geriatric Orthopedics and Multidisciplinary Care </h2>
      <p> I’ve contributed to reviews focusing on geriatric patients, particularly on how multidisciplinary care can improve outcomes in older adults with rib fractures. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rib Fracture Management in Older Adults: A scoping review that explores best practices for managing rib fractures in the geriatric population.</li>
