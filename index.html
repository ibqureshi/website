            <img class="profile-image" src="profile-pic.jpg" alt="Picture of Ibraheem Qureshi">
            <p>Growing up as the youngest of four siblings, I was surrounded by a whirlwind of hobbies and passions that shaped my worldview. From snowboarding to capturing everyday moments through my camera, I’ve always found beauty in the world around me. Medicine captivated me with its intersection of human connection and scientific reasoning. It offers intellectual challenge, hands-on practice, and personal interaction—constantly pushing me to learn, adapt, and serve.</p>
            <p>Being surrounded by family projects, our garage became a treasure trove of tools and materials. This upbringing drew me toward orthopedics, where I focus on making the broken functional again. Whether in the lab, clinic, or behind the camera, I’m excited to integrate science and art into a fulfilling medical career.</p>
