            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                From a young age, Iâ€™ve been surrounded by diverse hobbies and experiences, being the youngest of four siblings. Snowboarding, photography, and traveling have all played a role in shaping my perspective, but it was medicine that captivated me. Medicine uniquely combines hands-on skills, intellectual rigor, and constant learningâ€”all while interacting with and helping people. This dynamic nature drew me in and continues to fuel my passion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) at New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYITCOM) as part of an integrated 7-year B.S./D.O. program. In addition to my medical studies, Iâ€™ve explored research, coding, and videography, which further fuels my excitement to specialize in an area that matches my passions and skills.
